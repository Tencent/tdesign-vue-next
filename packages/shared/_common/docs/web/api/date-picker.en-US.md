## FAQ

### The backend data format is special. How can I format the date quickly?

The `onChange` callback event will return the currently selected date object wrapped in `dayjs`. You can format it with the help of a third-party library or use the provided `dayjs` object for custom conversion.

```js
<DatePicker onChange={(value, { dayjsValue }) => {
  const data = dayjsValue.format('YYYYMMDD');
  ...
}}>

<DateRangePicker onChange={(value, { dayjsValue }) => {
  const data = dayjsValue.map(d => d.format('YYYYMMDD'));
  ...
}}>
```
