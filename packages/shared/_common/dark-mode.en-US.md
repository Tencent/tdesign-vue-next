### Usage

add `theme-mode` attribution for `html` to control the display of `light/dark` mode：

```javascript
// dark mode
document.documentElement.setAttribute("theme-mode", "dark");
// light mode
document.documentElement.removeAttribute("theme-mode");
```

### Implementation Solution

TDesign uses [CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) to implement all color-related Design Tokens. Currently, almost all modern browsers support this feature. We have implemented two sets of color palettes, light and dark, by default, for applying when switching the page theme.

Read [the documentation](https://caniuse.com/css-variables) if you have doubts about the browser compatibility of this solution.
